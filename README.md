Specify postCommit only not the entire default hooks path



Locate your Git configuration directory, which is typically ~/.gitconfig on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) or %USERPROFILE%\.gitconfig on Windows.

Open the Git configuration file in a text editor.

Look for the [core] section in the configuration file. If it doesn't exist, create it.

Add the following line under the [core] section:

plaintext
Copy code
postCommit = /path/to/global/post-commit
Replace /path/to/global/post-commit with the actual path to the script or command you want to execute after each commit. Ensure that the script or command is executable.

Save the changes to the Git configuration file.

Navigate to the directory specified in the postCommit configuration. If the directory doesn't exist, create it.

Create a file named post-commit (without any file extension) in the directory specified in the postCommit configuration.

Open the post-commit file in a text editor and add the desired script or commands to be executed after each commit.

Save the post-commit file and make it executable if required.

By configuring the postCommit setting in your Git configuration file, you can specify the path to your global post-commit script or command, which will be executed after each commit in any Git repository on your system.

Please note that this approach relies on the postCommit configuration, which is supported in newer versions of Git (2.9 and above). If you are using an older version of Git, consider upgrading to utilize this functionality.
